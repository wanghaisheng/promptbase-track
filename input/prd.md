内链规划
```
You are absolutely correct. My apologies for the confusion in the previous responses. The strategy you pasted back, which emphasizes breaking down the PRD functionalities into distinct **tools** and planning the internal linking around them, is precisely the right approach.

Let's formally adopt and slightly refine that tool-focused strategy, aligning it with the detailed PRD (v1.7) and its workspace names.

**Updated Internal Linking Strategy (Tool-Focused - Aligned with PRD v1.7)**

**Core Goals:**

*   **Highlight Specific Tools/Workspaces:** Clearly communicate the capabilities available within each workspace (Review Explorer, AI Insights Hub, Competitor Workbench, Report Center, etc.).
*   **Showcase Integration:** Demonstrate how insights and actions flow between these workspaces.
*   **User Navigation:** Allow users to easily find information about the specific functionality or workspace that solves their pain point.
*   **SEO:** Target keywords related to specific functionalities (sentiment analysis, topic clustering, competitor comparison, app review search) and distribute link equity effectively.
*   **Conversion (Pre-Launch):** Guide users interested in *any* part of the suite towards the Beta signup.

**Key Workspaces/Tools (from PRD v1.7 UI Section):**

*   Main Dashboard (Overview & Entry Point)
*   Review Explorer Workspace (Search, Filter, Browse Reviews)
*   AI Insights Hub / Genius Engine Workspace (Sentiment, Topics, Needs, Priority)
*   Competitor Analysis Workbench (Comparisons, Competitor Review Analysis)
*   Report Center Workspace (Build, Manage, Schedule Reports)
*   *(Supporting Tools/Views implicitly needed: App Discovery, Rank Tracking, Alert Configuration/Feed)*

**Internal Linking Strategy Details:**

**1. Foundational Navigation (Header & Footer - ALL Pages):**

*   **Header Navigation (`<nav>`):**
    *   Logo -> `index.html` (or Main Dashboard post-login)
    *   Home (if separate from Dashboard) -> `index.html`
    *   **"Workspaces" / "Tools" Dropdown (Future):** Essential for navigating the suite. Links could include:
        *   Dashboard

    *   About Us -> `about.html`
    *   Careers -> `career.html`
    *   **(Future):** Pricing, Blog, Login/Signup CTAs.
*   **Footer Navigation (ALL Pages):**
    *   Standard links (About, Careers, Privacy, Terms, Contact).
    *   **(Future):** Link to a `/tools` overview page or sitemap.
    *   Language Switcher.

**2. Homepage (`index.html`) Linking Strategy (Showcasing the Suite):**

*   **Hero Section:** Emphasize integrated intelligence. CTAs link to `#tools-overview` or `#pricing-beta`. "Web & Mobile" links to access section.
*   **"Explore the Suite" / Tools Overview Section:**
    *   **Structure:** Use cards/sections for each key Workspace/Capability derived from PRD section 5 & detailed in section 7.
    *   **Content per Card:** Describe the core purpose (e.g., "Review Explorer: Search and filter millions of reviews instantly.") and key benefit. Use terminology from PRD v1.7 UI descriptions.
    *   **Linking (Future):** Each card links prominently to the future dedicated landing page for that workspace/tool (e.g., `<h2>AI Insights Hub</h2>...<a href="/tools/ai-insights-hub">Discover AI Insights</a>`). Use descriptive anchor text matching the workspace name.
    *   **Linking (Now - Pre-Launch):** Use anchor links (`#ai-insights-hub-description`) if detailed descriptions exist lower on the homepage, or simply describe the integration textually (e.g., "Leverage insights from the **AI Insights Hub** within the **Competitor Workbench**.").
    *   **Visuals:** Use relevant icons for each workspace/tool.
*   **AI "Genius Engine" Spotlight:** Detail unique AI features (from PRD 5.2). **(Future):** Link specific features to subsections on the `/tools/ai-insights-hub` page. **(Now):** Link this section anchor back to the "AI Insights Hub" card in the overview.
*   **Workflow Example / Integration Visual:** Show how data flows between workspaces (e.g., Find reviews in **Review Explorer** -> Analyze in **AI Insights Hub** -> Compare in **Competitor Workbench** -> Summarize in **Report Center**). Link each step text to the relevant tool card above.
*   **Pain Point Section:** Link pain points to the *primary workspace* addressing them (e.g., "Review Overload?" -> links to **Review Explorer** card; "Prioritization Challenge?" -> links to **AI Insights Hub** card).
*   **Insight Explorer (Demo):** Preview output should hint at data coming *from* different workspaces. CTA links to Beta signup (`#pricing-beta`).

**3. About Page (`about.html`) Linking Strategy:**

*   Link mentions of specific challenges ("making sense of reviews") contextually to the **AI Insights Hub** description on `index.html` (or future `/tools/ai-insights-hub` page).
*   Link mentions of "understanding the market" to **Competitor Workbench** or future **Discovery/Ranking** tool descriptions/pages.
*   Link mentions of AI expertise specifically to the **AI Insights Hub** description/page.
*   Link hiring mentions to `career.html`.
*   Include Beta signup CTA (`index.html#pricing-beta`).

**4. Career Page (`career.html`) Linking Strategy:**

*   Link tech stack mentions back to `index.html` or relevant tool descriptions (e.g., NLP role -> **AI Insights Hub**).
*   Link company mission to `about.html`.

**5. Future Dedicated Workspace/Tool Pages (`/tools/*`) Linking Strategy:**

*   **Crucial Cross-Linking:** This is where the integration becomes tangible for users and search engines.
    *   **Review Explorer (`/tools/review-explorer`):** Link selected reviews/filters to the **AI Insights Hub** for analysis (`/tools/ai-insights-hub`), to the **Competitor Workbench** (`/tools/competitor-workbench`) to analyze a specific app's reviews found here, and to the **Report Center** (`/tools/report-center`) to include raw data snippets.
    *   **AI Insights Hub (`/tools/ai-insights-hub`):** Link findings back to filtered views in the **Review Explorer**. Link competitor insights to the **Competitor Workbench**. Allow adding specific charts/insights directly to the **Report Center**. Link high-priority issues to **Alert Configuration**.
    *   **Competitor Workbench (`/tools/competitor-workbench`):** Link to **Rank Tracking** views. Heavily integrate views/data from the **AI Insights Hub** (for competitor review analysis). Feed comparisons into the **Report Center**. Link competitor activity to **Alert Configuration**.
    *   **Report Center (`/tools/report-center`):** Link to *all other workspace pages* explaining how their specific data modules can be added to reports. Link to **Settings** for branding.
*   **Deep Linking:** Link specific terms (e.g., "Emotional Intensity") to glossary/help docs/blog posts.
*   **User Flow Guidance:** Use buttons/links to suggest next logical steps (e.g., after analyzing your reviews -> "Compare these topics with competitors").
*   **Conversion CTAs:** Ensure prominent Beta signup/Login links.

**6. Blog/Resources Linking Strategy:**

*   Create content focused on *tasks* achieved using specific workspaces (e.g., "How to Find Feature Requests Using the AI Insights Hub," "Building Your Weekly Competitor Report in the Report Center").
*   Link these posts directly to the relevant workspace pages (`/tools/*`).
*   Link from workspace pages back to relevant tutorials or use cases on the blog.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   **(Now - Pre-Launch):** Focus on logical structure on the `index.html` page, using clear headings for each tool/workspace description. Use intra-page anchor links (`#...`) where appropriate. Cross-reference tools textually to explain integration. Ensure `about.html` and `career.html` link back correctly.
*   **(Future):** Implement the "Tools" dropdown nav. Create dedicated landing pages for each key workspace/tool (`/tools/*`). Build out the extensive cross-linking between these pages as described.
*   **Anchor Text:** Use descriptive anchor text matching workspace names or specific functionalities (e.g., "Analyze competitor reviews," "Build a custom report," "Explore sentiment trends").

This updated, tool-and-workspace-focused internal linking strategy directly reflects the structure and capabilities detailed in PRD v1.7, providing a clear roadmap for user navigation and SEO on the App Insights Suite website.
